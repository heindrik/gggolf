gggolf is a team project for CSC444 Software Engineering I course at UofT.

Following is one good practice to git branching: (This is what my friends and I use for our capstone, feel free to change it if you think we can do better)

###Merge steps

1. Create a task in trello
2. git checkout -b ticket_name
3. git push -u origin ticket_name:ticket_name
4. Make changes on the local branch
5. Change file.rb, file2.rb etc
6. Commit the changes to the local branchâ€¦
7. push the change to the remote repo a. git push origin
8. After first commit & push, create a new Pull request from github
9. Pull the latest changes from master & merge a. git checkout master b. git pull c. git checkout richard-1-testing d. git rebase master (& squash commits)
10. Make another commit.
11. Push the branch to git hub a. git push -f origin
12. From github on the branch, create a new Pull Request.
13. Send comments or requests for Code Review by adding making comments with @ included at the bottom a. Or by sending the link to ECE496 FB chatting room
14. When the CR is signed off and do the merge directly through github

###Rebase steps
1. git rebase -i master a. fixup the extra commits if you want
2. When conflicts happen 
2.1. resolves the conflict locally,(Head -> master & branch sha -> my code (topic branch))
2.2. git add .
2.3. git rebase --continue
2.4. Or git rebase --abort


Note: I put it in README so that it's easy for people to refer. Later on once everyone is familiar with it, we can place it elsewhere.
